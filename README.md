# Spotly

The purpose of Spotly was to create a machine learning algorithm that uses statistical modeling to compute the likelihood of a song becoming a Billboard top song by analyzing its attributes.

To do this, Spotly used a total of 1000 random tracks from each of the following years:

* 1990-1995
* 2000
* 2005
* 2010
* 2015
* 2019

to compare the attributes and eventually generate the criteria of what makes a top song. However, after an extensive analysis using both R & Python, we found that the machine learning platforms could only predict what DOES NOT make a top song.
